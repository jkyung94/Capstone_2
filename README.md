# What makes a song a hit?

## Problem
Each year, more than a million songs are released annually, which means that even if one person listened to music and nothing else throughout the day, this person may not come across an artist's song, unless told by a friend or media that says this particular song is a hit. It's no wonder artists have such a hard time making a living. The goal of this project is to find what features of a song makes it popular and to create a recommender that will let one know which hot songs are like their song of choice. Additionally, a model was created to attempt to predict which songs will be in the top 10 hits of the year based off of information given.
